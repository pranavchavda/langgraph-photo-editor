### 🆕 `chat` - Interactive Chat Mode (NEW!)
```bash
python photo_editor.py chat
```

**Natural language photo processing instructions!** Chat directly with the AI system:

```
🤖 Your instruction: Process ../luce-images/ with brighter colors and more vibrant look

🎯 Understood:
   📁 Target: ../luce-images/
   📝 Instructions: brighter colors and more vibrant look  
   ⚙️  Processing mode: batch

Proceed with processing? [y/n]: y
```

**Chat Examples:**
- `"Process /path/to/images/ with brighter colors and sharper details"`
- `"Make the coffee machines in ./luce-images/ more vibrant"`
- `"Process image.jpg but keep it more natural, less saturated"`
- `"Apply chrome optimization to all steel machines in folder/"`

**Features:**
- 🧠 **Intelligent parsing** - Claude understands your instructions
- 📁 **Smart file detection** - Automatically detects files vs directories  
- 🎨 **Custom optimization** - Adjusts analysis based on your style preferences
- ✅ **Confirmation** - Shows what was understood before processing

### `process` - Single Image Processing
```bash
python photo_editor.py process IMAGE_PATH [--instructions "custom instructions"] [--output-dir DIR]
```

- Processes one image with live progress display
- Shows real-time agent status and quality scores
- Automatic retry with QC refinements

### `batch` - Batch Processing  
```bash
python photo_editor.py batch INPUT_DIR [OPTIONS]
```

Options:
- `--output-dir DIR` - Output directory for processed images
- `--max-concurrent N` - Max concurrent processing (default: 3)
- `--pattern GLOB` - File pattern to match (default: `*.{jpg,jpeg,png,webp}`)

### `test` - Configuration Test
```bash
python photo_editor.py test
```

Validates:
- API key configuration
- ImageMagick availability  
- System readiness

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Keys (Required)
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** - Claude Sonnet 4 vision analysis and QC
- **GEMINI_API_KEY** - Gemini 2.5 Flash AI image editing (get from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- **REMOVE_BG_API_KEY** - Background removal (optional, will skip if missing)

### Processing Settings
- **MAX_CONCURRENT_IMAGES** - Batch processing concurrency (default: 3)
- **RETRY_ATTEMPTS** - QC retry attempts (default: 2)
- **QUALITY_THRESHOLD** - Minimum QC score for pass (default: 0.8)

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Enhanced Analysis Phase 🔍
Claude Sonnet 4 analyzes the image and determines the optimal processing strategy:

**Gemini Strategy** 🤖 - For complex edits requiring AI understanding:
- Chrome/metal surface enhancement with natural reflections
- Artistic color adjustments and vibrance improvements  
- Complex lighting corrections and shadow management
- Detail enhancement while maintaining natural appearance

**ImageMagick Strategy** ⚡ - For simple parameter adjustments:
- Basic brightness, contrast, saturation adjustments
- Simple gamma corrections
- Standard color cast removal

The analysis examines:
- Surface materials (chrome, stainless steel, matte, glass)
- Lighting quality and shadow issues
- Color accuracy and vibrance needs
- Complex vs simple editing requirements

### 2. AI Image Editing Phase 🤖 (Gemini Strategy)
When complex editing is needed, Gemini 2.5 Flash performs:
- **Natural language instructions** - Processes custom user instructions like "enhance chrome" or "make more vibrant"
- **Intelligent modifications** - Understands surface materials and applies appropriate enhancements
- **Quality preservation** - Maintains image quality while making sophisticated adjustments
- **Context awareness** - Considers the product type and desired commercial appearance

### 3. Background Removal 🎨
- Uses remove.bg API for professional background removal
- Always outputs WebP format for transparency support
- Handles rate limiting and error recovery

### 4. Optimization Phase ⚡ (ImageMagick Strategy)
For simpler adjustments, applies ImageMagick commands based on analysis:
- **Brightness/Contrast** adjustments for exposure correction
- **Saturation** enhancement for product vibrancy
- **Gamma** correction for tonal balance
- **Chrome/Steel** specific processing for reflective surfaces
- **Single-frame** output to prevent animated WebP issues

### 5. Quality Control ✅
Claude evaluates the processed image:
- **Professional appearance** - Clean, commercial quality
- **Color accuracy** - Natural, not oversaturated  
- **Lighting quality** - Even, no harsh shadows
- **Detail preservation** - Sharp product features
- **Background quality** - Clean transparency

**QC Scoring:** 0-10 scale where 8+ passes, <8 triggers retry with refinements.

## 📊 Progress Display

Rich terminal UI shows:
- **Real-time agent status** with emoji indicators
- **Quality scores** from QC analysis
- **Retry attempts** and refinement details
- **Error tracking** with detailed messages
- **Batch progress** with success rates

## 🔄 Retry Logic

When QC fails (score < 8):
1. **Analyze issues** - QC agent identifies specific problems
2. **Refine parameters** - Adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, gamma
3. **Retry processing** - Re-run optimization with refined settings
4. **Max attempts** - Up to 2 retries, then return best attempt

## 🎨 Input/Output Formats

**Supported Inputs:**
- JPG/JPEG - Standard photo format
- PNG - With alpha channel support
- WebP - Modern web format

**Outputs:**
- **Always WebP** - Preserves transparency from background removal
